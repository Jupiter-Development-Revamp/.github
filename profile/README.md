**Jupiter Development**

Welcome to **Jupiter Development**! Also known as Jupiter by our peers, we provide high-tech and quality **scripting solutions**. Innovation has always been at the core of Jupiter,  since 2019, and moving forward, we take great pride in our work. We are proud to be one of the few offering free open-source resources for all users. We will never release anything closed-source or charge for our work—Jupiter is a development team dedicated to teaching people and assisting many since **2019**.

📜 **Background**

Originally founded in 2019, Jupiter focused on cheats and unfair advantages. However, we have since shifted direction. We no longer develop cheats or exploits; instead, we are rewriting our shared history and making our past right by creating Anti-Cheat solutions.

🔴 **You will not find any of our old works!!!**

🚀 **Projects**

Despite our history dating back to 2019, Jupiter Development currently has a select number of public repositories. Our primary focus is on Anti-Cheat solutions to help protect games and developers on Roblox. We firmly believe that security tools and development resources should be free and accessible to all.

🔹 **Armed Vortex** - A fully functional **Anti-Cheat system** still in development but already available for viewing.

🔹 **Project Veritas** - A fully functional **Anti-Cheat**, not recommended for use though, it is client-sided.

🔹 **Roblox Command Handlers** - A fully functional **command detector**, mostly used for admin systems.

👨‍💻 **Developers**

Jupiter Development is owned and operated by **StyxDeveloper (John)**.
