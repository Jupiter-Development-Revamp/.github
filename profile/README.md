# Jupiter Development

Welcome to the new Jupiter, now under the aliase Jupiter Development. With a change from our old ideals and beliefs, we now develop Lua scripts. Jupiter has gone through so much in such a short time, however, with its new innovations moving forward. We plan to ensure that we have moved on from our rocky and failed past, moving forward with a new and refreshed focus and purpose. Planning to persue what is valuable to us and you the consumer. Pioneering the future of game development, Jupiter is now officially apart of the Roblox community. Wanting to answer the call for new learning resources within the Roblox ecosystem. 

## Background
Jupiter was founded in a community that benefits no one and helps no one. Today, Jupiter Development stands as it's own separate identity, no longer creating exploits and cheats, but rather being beneficial to everyone. Providing new meaning to its former past. This rebrand from Jupiter to Jupiter Development is important signifying the future of an ethical and a commitment to a legitimate game Development. We've removed all old projects, as these violated Roblox Terms Of Service and our new values and beliefs. 

## Current Focus
Currently, Jupiter Development is in its early stages of development, already having two projects in development (https://github.com/Jupiter-Development-Revamp/Roblox Anticheat). With a power to prevent exploiters, Jupiter is dedicated to teaching new people as well as themselves and going into fields they aren't comfortable in. 

## Future Plans
Preparing for the future, Jupiter plans on offering many things, future projects, and future innovations to problems. With a long road of experience, we pave the way to new grounds and explore new things and places this has never been before. Venturing towards Anticheat solutions and venturing towards game development. Including possible future games, FPS and maybe even a really good game for horror.
